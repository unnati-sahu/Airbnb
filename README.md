# Airbnb+ Vacation Home Rental Website

This project is a static website for vacation home rentals, built using HTML and CSS, and inspired by Airbnb. It showcases various vacation homes with images, descriptions, and pricing.  While it provides a visually appealing interface, it's important to note that the search and reservation functionalities are currently for demonstration purposes only and do not connect to a backend or database.

## Features

### HTML

* **Semantic HTML5:**  Utilizes elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and accessibility.
* **Forms and Inputs:** Includes a search form with input fields for location, check-in/out dates, and number of guests. However, these inputs currently only provide a visual representation of a search function.
* **Bootstrap 5 Components:** Incorporates Bootstrap's carousel for displaying multiple images of each listing, as well as the Bootstrap grid system for responsive layout.
* **External Links:** Uses `<a>` elements to link to external resources like Google Maps for the "Explore" page.
* **Dropdown Menu:** Employs a dropdown menu for the user profile section with options for "Sign In" and "Sign Up." This dropdown menu is purely visual at the moment.

### CSS

* **Responsive Design:**  Uses media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
* **Flexbox:**  Used for layout and alignment of elements within the header, navigation, and search bar.
* **Grid:** Used for arranging the listing cards in a responsive grid layout.
* **External Stylesheet:**  Uses `styles.css` for organizing and managing styles.
* **CSS Transitions:** Adds smooth hover effects to various elements, including navigation links, listing cards, and buttons.
* **Hero Section:**  Creates an eye-catching hero section with a background video and overlaying text. The background video is set to `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted`.
* **Carousel Styling:** Styles the Bootstrap carousel for showcasing multiple images per listing.
* **Footer Styling:** Styles the footer with language and currency selectors (non-functional), social media icons, and copyright information. The social media icons are linked to '#' and do not lead to any specific pages.
* **Dropdown Styling:** Styles the user profile dropdown menu.
* **Airbnb Inspired Design:** Incorporates similar colors and styles to create an Airbnb-like experience.

## Functionality

This website is a static representation of a vacation home rental platform.  Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

* **Homepage (`index.html`):** Displays a hero section with a search bar and a selection of featured listings. The search bar elements are not functionally connected. Clicking the "Reserve" button does not trigger any action.
* **Experiences Page (`experience.html`):** Showcases a variety of experiences with images and descriptions, along with details on how to book an experience. However, the booking functionality is not implemented.
* **Navigation:** Users can navigate between the homepage and the experiences page. The "Explore" link in the navigation bar opens Google Maps in a new tab.  The profile dropdown is purely visual.
* **Image Carousel:** Each listing features an image carousel that allows users to scroll through multiple photos.
* **Responsive Behavior:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Limitations

* **Static Content:**  The website content is static and not dynamically generated.
* **No Backend Integration:** There's no connection to a backend server or database. The search functionality, user authentication, and reservation features are purely visual and do not perform any real actions.

## Future Improvements

* **Backend Integration:** Implement a backend to handle search queries, user authentication, and booking requests.
* **Dynamic Content:** Fetch listing data from a database or external API.
* **Interactive Search:** Enable functional search based on location, dates, and guests.
* **User Authentication:**  Allow users to create accounts, sign in, and manage their bookings.
* **Payment Integration:** Implement a payment gateway for processing reservations.
